                "From day one, before NetSoft came on-site for install, the <em><strong>communication</strong></em> and
                <em><strong>service</strong></em>from <br>
                 NetSoft have been superior.  Every person on staff at Netsoft is <em><strong>helpful.</strong></em> 
                If they do not know <br>
                the answer, they know who to guide me to in order for me to get the answer.  I've never been <br>
                told NetSoft "can't" do the job I've asked them to do."

                    team on standardization and process improvement for 5 separate entities, all of which are <br>
                    customized differently.  NetSoft provides unmatched, personal support to all users of their <br>

                "Intellipath has worked diligently with us to integrate their LIS product into our EHR and <br>
                 Practice management platforms.  This integration has allowed us to streamline efficiency by <br>
                not having to segregate workflows between user applications.  Having worked in the <br>
                dermatology industry for some time this has not always been the case with other LIS systems <br>
                I have used in the past."

                <p>"The NetSoft team has provided top notch customer service for our team.  I have had nothing <br>
                    but great interactions with the support staff as they always drop what they are doing to <br>
                    resolve an issue or keep me abreast of an expected resolution time should an issue require <br>
                    further troubleshooting."

                <p> "One of the biggest risks/liability in dermatology is associated with the processing of <br>
                     pathology tests.  Having worked with Intellipath integrating the product seamlessly via HL-7 <br>
                    Interface gives me the peace of mind that nothing will fall through the cracks."

                <p> "The greatest strength is the people.  The Intellipath team has come onsite multiple times <br>
                    to help refine our workflows to make sure we are staying abreast of the operational best <br>
                    practices for derm path processing."

                    you are not important to them.  We do not feel this way with NetSoft. This is really important <br>
                    to me and my staff.”
